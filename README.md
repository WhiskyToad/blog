# <p align="center">Introduction </p>

I wanted to grow my online presence and also learn some new things, so I created a blog. Hosted on Netlify and Heroku, both because they are simple to use from the CLI allowing me quick and easy deployment.

## <p align="center">Front-End

### <p align="center">React

It's what I'd been using and it seems to be what most people use and it makes no sense to reinvent the wheel when it works so well.

### <p align="center">Chakra UI

My goto for a quick, easy and great looking UI library. Allows me to style quickly and keep my code simple.

### <p align="center">Framer Motion

Something I am just picking up and learning, very simple and easy to use to create nice interactive displays.
Combined with React Intersection Observer for animation when in view. Chakra UI also has inbuilt functionality for Framer.

### <p align="center">React Query

I had heard about this for a while, having experience with Redux and Apollo previously I wanted to give this a try.
I really like it, will be my goto tech for fetching and caching data from now on. Simple to use, automatic background fetching and
a third of the size of Apollo.

### <p align="center">Django

I love the name first and foremost, I wanted to get back into Python and I already knew Django was great for blogs.

### <p align="center">Summernote

A django package that provides a great text editor for creating my blog posts allowing me to simply create and format my posts.

### <p align="center">PostgreSQL

I needed to learn more about relational databases and decided on giving PostgreSQL a try.

### <p align="center">Cloudinary

For easy image hosting.
